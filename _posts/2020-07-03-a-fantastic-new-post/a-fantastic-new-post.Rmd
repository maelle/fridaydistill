In this post, we shall see stuff.

## A section

Some code below

```{r}
a <- 1:10
plot(a)
```

what a nice package[@refmanager] built on top of R[@my-citation-key-for-r].

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

I write a sentence [^footnote].

[^footnote]: but I also want to mention this off-topic thing
